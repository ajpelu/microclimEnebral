This repository contains information about the dataset: 
Hourly temperature data from the ADAPTAMED Juniper-thicket plots located at two contrasting slopes (northern and southern) of Sierra Nevada mountain (Spain). Since 2017 several temperature loggers (n=21) were set up at five different microhabitat within High-mountain scrublands: stone, shrubland (Genista species), shrubland (Juniperus communis), open ground, and wet meadow. The sensors (HOBO TidbiT Temperature Data Logger) were placed at 5 cm depth. They record data every hour. Data were cleaned and validated by range.
